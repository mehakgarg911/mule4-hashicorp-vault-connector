=== Config


Default configuration


==== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | *x*{nbsp}
| Connection a| <<Config_Connection, Connection>>
 | The connection types that can be provided to this configuration. | | *x*{nbsp}
| Name a| String |  The identifier of this element used to reference it in other components |  | *x*{nbsp}
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform will expire the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime will actually purge the instances when it sees it fit. |  | {nbsp}

| Truststore Password a| String |  Truststore Password, only must be set if the truststore path is |  | {nbsp}
| TLS enabled a| Boolean |  If checked the connector will establish a HTTPS connection with the Vault, HTTP otherwise |  false | {nbsp}
| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to true, deployment will fail if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy |  | {nbsp}

== Types
[[Reconnection]]
=== Reconnection

[cols=".^20%,.^25%,.^30%,.^15%,.^10%", options="header"]
|======================
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Fails Deployment a| Boolean | When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to true, deployment will fail if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy |  | 
| Reconnection Strategy a| * <<Reconnect>>
* <<ReconnectForever>> | The reconnection strategy to use |  | 
|======================

[[Reconnect]]
=== Reconnect

[cols=".^20%,.^25%,.^30%,.^15%,.^10%", options="header"]
|======================
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Frequency a| Number | How often (in ms) to reconnect |  | 
| Blocking a| Boolean | If false, the reconnection strategy will run in a separate, non-blocking thread |  | 
| Count a| Number | How many reconnection attempts to make |  | 
|======================

[[ReconnectForever]]
=== Reconnect Forever

[cols=".^20%,.^25%,.^30%,.^15%,.^10%", options="header"]
|======================
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Frequency a| Number | How often (in ms) to reconnect |  | 
| Blocking a| Boolean | If false, the reconnection strategy will run in a separate, non-blocking thread |  | 
|======================

[[PoolingProfile]]
=== Pooling Profile

[cols=".^20%,.^25%,.^30%,.^15%,.^10%", options="header"]
|======================
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Active a| Number | Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can be borrowed from a session at one time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of components that may be active at one time. When maxActive is exceeded, the pool is said to be exhausted. |  | 
| Max Idle a| Number | Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can sit idle in the pool at any time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of Mule components that may be idle at one time. |  | 
| Max Wait a| Number | Specifies the number of milliseconds to wait for a pooled component to become available when the pool is exhausted and the exhaustedAction is set to WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT. |  | 
| Min Eviction Millis a| Number | Determines the minimum amount of time an object may sit idle in the pool before it is eligible for eviction. When non-positive, no objects will be evicted from the pool due to idle time alone. |  | 
| Eviction Check Interval Millis a| Number | Specifies the number of milliseconds between runs of the object evictor. When non-positive, no object evictor is executed. |  | 
| Exhausted Action a| Enumeration, one of:

** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW
** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT
** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_FAIL | Specifies the behavior of the Mule component pool when the pool is exhausted. Possible values are: "WHEN_EXHAUSTED_FAIL", which will throw a NoSuchElementException, "WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT", which will block by invoking Object.wait(long) until a new or idle object is available, or WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW, which will create a new Mule instance and return it, essentially making maxActive meaningless. If a positive maxWait value is supplied, it will block for at most that many milliseconds, after which a NoSuchElementException will be thrown. If maxThreadWait is a negative value, it will block indefinitely. |  | 
| Initialisation Policy a| Enumeration, one of:

** INITIALISE_NONE
** INITIALISE_ONE
** INITIALISE_ALL | Determines how components in a pool should be initialized. The possible values are: INITIALISE_NONE (will not load any components into the pool on startup), INITIALISE_ONE (will load one initial component into the pool on startup), or INITIALISE_ALL (will load all components in the pool on startup) |  | 
| Disabled a| Boolean | Whether pooling should be disabled |  | 
|======================

[[ExpirationPolicy]]
=== Expiration Policy

[cols=".^20%,.^25%,.^30%,.^15%,.^10%", options="header"]
|======================
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Idle Time a| Number | A scalar time value for the maximum amount of time a dynamic configuration instance should be allowed to be idle before it's considered eligible for expiration |  | 
| Time Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS | A time unit that qualifies the maxIdleTime attribute |  |
